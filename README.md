# Yeti Forums
Yeti Forums is a simple PHP/MySQL forums solution running on the Codeigniter & Bulma Css frameworks. It is a project I am developing in my spare time after a lengthy break from any form of coding.

<strong>Installation:</strong><br>

Installation has been made straight forward due to a build in installer. Simply upload the files to your desired location E.g http://www.yousite.com/forums and navigate to that location. You will be greeted by the installer that will take you through the setup process, you will require you MySQL details, however the database and tables will all be generated automatically.

<strong>WARNING!</strong><br>
This software is not yet ready for Production Environments, it is still very much in EARLY APLHA and will contain bugs. Please feel free to use it for testing purposes and nothing more. I am working hard to get this project into the Beta stages as fast as possible, so please check back for updates.

<strong>Getting Involved</strong><br>
Please feel free to contribute to the project, you can either fork the project and send pull requests or you can even submit feature requests via the Issues section here on GitHub.
